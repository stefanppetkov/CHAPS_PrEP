# Short-term oral pre-exposure prophylaxis against HIV-1 modulates the transcriptome of foreskin tissue

Whilst short-term oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with antiretroviral drugs in men who have sex with men has shown protection against HIV-1 infection, the impact of this regimen on the in vivo foreskin transcriptome is unknown. We collected foreskin tissue after voluntary medical male circumcision from 144 young men (72 from Uganda and 72 from South Africa) randomized to one to two doses of either oral tenofovir (TFV) disoproxil fumarate (FTC-TDF) or tenofovir alafenamide (FTC-TAF) or no drug (untreated controls). This novel approach allowed us to examine the impact of short-term oral PrEP on transcriptome of the male genital tract. A single dose of FTC-TDF did not affect the foreskin transcriptome in relation to control arm, however one dose of FTC-TAF induced upregulation of four genes AKAP8, KIAA0141, HSCB and METTL17. Following two doses of either FTC-TDF or FTC-TAF, there was an increase in 34 differentially expressed genes for FTC-TDF and 15 for FTC-TAF, with nine DEGs in common: KIAA0141, SAFB2, CACTIN, FXR2, AKAP8, HSCB, CLNS1A, DDX27 and DCAF15. Functional analysis of differentially expressed genes revealed modulation of biological processes related to mitochondrial stress (KIAA0141, HSCB and METTL17), anti-viral and anti-inflammatory pathways (CACTIN and AKAP8). Our results show that short-course on-demand oral PrEP in men modulates genes in foreskin tissue which are likely unfavorable to HIV acquisition and replication. We also describe an upregulated expression of genes involved in diverse mitochondria biology which may potentially result in worsened mitochondria-related. These results warrant further studies to assess the role of short-course and prolonged oral PrEP on biological processes of the foreskin mucosa.

Differential gene expression analysis of South African and Ugandan cohorts. Individuals from South Africa and Uganda were stratified according to the type of administered PrEP drug and the expression of transcripts was compared to the corresponding control arm or between drug groups. Only comparisons with statistically significant (p < 0.05) differentially expressed genes (protein-coding, N=15378) are shown for each country.

## Similarity of SA and Uganda cohorts

Similarity of control specimens in Uganda and South Africa. To evaluate the extent of inter-country variability we performed a differential expression analysis between the control arms of South Africa and Uganda. Panel (A) depicts the distribution of control specimens produced by PCA; the overlap between the two countries is shown by corresponding ellipse. Panel (B) shows the detection of 3 DEGs between the controls from the two trial sites.

## Number of PrEP doses affects foreskin transcriptome changes

Principal component analysis of Uganda and South Africa trial arms combined together. Specimens from the two trial sites were analyzed based on the type of PrEP and number of administered doses. PCA was then performed using protein coding transcripts (N=15378). The overlap between the trial arms from two countries is shown by corresponding ellipses. A color coding in the figure denotes the different trial arms.
